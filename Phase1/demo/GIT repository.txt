Objectives:-

understand and use github

explain different types of git repositories

working with repo - forking, push/pull, branch

-------------

repo:-

its like a folder contains source code files and each file's revision history

Local repo 
remote repo

communicaation between local and remote repository will be of two typical proces:- PUSH and PULL

-------------

terminologies origin:-

In GIT "origin" is shortand name for remote repo

---
when we dont have direct access with remote repo we will use fork method to get code into local repo

------
git clone -- to make a local copy of remote repo

----------

PUSH and PULL

we can push data from local to remote repo 

we can pull data from remote to local

----------


PULL = Fetch + merge

git fetch  --> will not do any changes in local repo, it will just downloads the content

for PULL --> it will download and merge the new changes in the local repo

------------


GIT --> cloud based repository hosting service

-----------------------------------------


create a  repository in your account:-

to bring connection with local and github repo run command:-

git remote add origin <remote_repo_url>

remote_repo_url --> will be depending on different organizantions like bit bucket, github, gitlab

ex:- git remote add origin https://GitHub.com/<username>/<local

once remote repositories have been configured:-

git remote  --> will connect with other repo

git remote -v --> shows all the URL's at remote repo when listing curent connections

-----------


how to configure SSH keys:-

-to connect and authenticate to remote servers and services
- SSH keys , one can connect to github without supplying username and personal access token at each visit
- for password less communication, SSH can be used

to establish SSH communication:-

public key, private key
-------------------
check for existing SSH keys:-

ls -al ~/.ssh

public keys:-

id_rsa.pub
id_ecdsa.pub
id_ed25519.pub

--------------

generate a new key:-

ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -c "mail_id"
if keys exist, it asks for overwriting

by default SSH keys will pickup id_RSA, id_DSA are standard and are not required to be loaded
into the operating system

if we want to add new key, we need to add key to SSH-agent

set up SSH:-

1. check / Run SSH-agent in background --> eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"

2. Add key to SSH-agent --> ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519

3. check the SSH connection ---> ssh -T git@github.com

----------
we can communicate with remote rep using HTTP, https, SSH

we needd to add public key to create communication with remote 

public key :- cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub

----------------

when u want to get latest version of repo:-

git repo clone <url>

--
if we want to get a sepcific version from local repo 
or latest update for a specific file:-

git checkout --<filename>

------------------------


delete a branch only in local system :- git branch -d branch_name

delete a local and remote branch :- git branch -d branch_name

delete a branch only in the remote :- git push origin --delete branch_naame
